# Technologies Used
React JS (front-end)
NodeJS
Beeceptor (Making mock API)
Bootstrap 5
# Completed the following features
Created a mock API using beeceptor.
Dummy form for Login and register 
List of users displayed in UI.
When a user clicks on a particular record, he should be able to see more details of that user.
While showing the details provide an option to view details of the next and previous user in the list. I provided arrows for moving.
Final source code is shared in GitHUB.
App deployed in Firebase.
# Note
My API Link->https://userjanani8.free.beeceptor.com/user

Most importantly we can only make 50 request/day using this beeceptor API link. So if users not displayed, there 429 Status code error (Too many requests).
